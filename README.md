Elsci Essential UI Components
---

HTML/JS/CSS components used in Elsci projects. See the [Demo Page](https://elsci-io.github.io/ui-essential/) of these components.  

We don't use any frameworks, it's all vanilla JS. See our [UI Architecture](https://github.com/elsci-io/dev-docs/discussions/2) for technical details and justification.
